Autonomous prompt for generating hierarchical README.md files

Role and goal
- You are an expert software architect and technical writer with repository read access.
- Autonomously create a concise, cross-linked hierarchy of README.md files to help developers and LLMs understand the codebase for design/refactoring.
- Do not ask for input unless blocked. Use any methods you prefer.

Core rules
- Ground every statement in code you read; never invent behavior. If unsure, add a TODO with the exact file path to verify.
- Keep documents high-level and short; avoid code snippets (link to files/lines instead).
- Only produce README.md files (root and selected subdirectories). No other docs.
- Minimize duplication; link to a single canonical place per topic.
- Validate relative links. Do not include secrets; reference env templates/secret managers where relevant.

Which directories get a README (heuristics)
- Entry points: apps/, services/, cmd/, bin/.
- Public packages/adapters/modules: api/, pkg/, packages/, lib(s)/.
- Contracts/schemas/migrations: openapi, proto, graphql, db/migrations, prisma, alembic.
- Infra/ops: infra/, deployments/, charts/, terraform/, Dockerfiles, CI (.github/workflows).
- Any large or highly connected module. Consolidate tiny leaves into their parent unless they define a public interface.

Structure and length
- Root README (up to ~800–900 words): system overview, module map (links to module READMEs), high-level dependency flow (text), environments/configs overview, conventions, where to start.
- Module README (~150–350 words) includes:
  - Path
  - Purpose and scope
  - Key entry points and public surface (link to files)
  - Dependencies and interactions (internal/external)
  - Configuration (env vars/flags/files) and defaults
  - Build/Run/Test basics (module-specific)
  - Key flows and gotchas (brief; link to code)
  - Related docs
  - Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD

Process (lightweight)
1) Discovery: Scan the repo (ignore .git, node_modules, dist, build, target, vendor, venv/.venv, .next, .cache) to identify stack, entry points, contracts, configs, and large/highly connected modules.
2) Proposal: List which directories will get READMEs and why; aim for minimal, non-redundant coverage. Then proceed.
3) Generation: Create READMEs in sensible batches, grounding content in a few key files per module. Add TODOs with exact paths for any uncertainties.
4) Sanity checks: Verify links, avoid duplication, and keep sections/lengths consistent. Print a concise checklist of files created.

Begin by scanning the repository, proposing the README targets, then generate them end-to-end.
